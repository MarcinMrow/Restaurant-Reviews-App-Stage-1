# Front-End Nanodegree Restaurant Reviews App Project

## Project Overview

Implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

### There are several goals for the **Restaurant Reviews** projects:
1. Convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
2. Take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
3. Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.
4. Update the code to resolve issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Specification of a starter code for a restaurant reviews website:
1. It is barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device.
2. It does not include any standard accessibility features.
3. It does not work offline.

### Created for [**Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program**](https://eu.udacity.com/).

## Visit a website

* [Click here](https://marcinmrow.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage-1/).

## Getting started

1. Download/ clone the repository 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MarcinMrow/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage-1.git
```
2. Go to the directory.

3. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer:

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 

If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m http.server 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use).

If you have Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
